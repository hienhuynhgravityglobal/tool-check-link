# Link # Character Checker for Sitemaps

A tool that processes XML sitemaps, retrieves all pages, and scans them for links with href="#", excluding those in headers and navigation menus.

## Setup and Installation

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer
2. Open a terminal/command prompt in this directory
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm start` to start the server
5. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000

## How to Use

1. Enter a sitemap URL in the input field (e.g., https://example.com/sitemap_index.xml)
2. Click the "Process Sitemap and Check Links" button
3. The tool will:
   - Process the sitemap or sitemap index
   - Find all pages linked in the sitemap(s)
   - Check each page for links with href="#" (excluding those in headers)
   - Display a summary of results

## Features

- **Multi-level Sitemap Processing**:
  - Handles both sitemap index files and regular sitemaps
  - For sitemap index files, it processes all child sitemaps
  - Extracts all URLs from sitemaps

- **Smart Page Analysis**:
  - Visits each page listed in the sitemap(s)
  - Checks for links with exactly href="#"
  - **Excludes links in headers, navigation bars, and menus**
  - Shows which pages contain these links
  - Displays the link text and context information

- **Context Information**:
  - Provides context for each link found (surrounding text or parent element)
  - Helps identify where in the page the link appears
  - Makes it easier to locate and fix issues

- **Real-time Progress Tracking**:
  - Shows current processing stage
  - Displays progress bar
  - Updates count of pages checked and results found
  - Provides a live summary while processing

- **Results Display**:
  - Clear summary of total pages checked
  - Count of pages with href="#" links
  - Total number of href="#" links found
  - Collapsible sections to view link details

## Technical Details

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with progress tracking
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, Axios, and XML parsing
- **Technologies Used**:
  - Express: Web server framework
  - Axios: HTTP client for making requests
  - xml2js: XML parsing library
  - jsdom: HTML parsing and DOM manipulation
  - CORS: Cross-origin resource sharing support

## Performance Notes

- The tool processes sitemaps and pages in batches to avoid overwhelming the server
- For large sitemaps with many pages, processing may take some time
- The progress bar and live summary provide feedback during processing

## Header Detection

The tool automatically excludes links in the following elements:
- `<header>` tags
- `<nav>` elements
- Elements with class or ID containing "header", "navigation", "navbar", "main-nav"
- This helps filter out navigation menus which often contain "#" links

## Notes

- The tool requires running the Node.js server to work properly
- This approach can access most websites, including those that would normally trigger CORS errors
- For internal/VPN sites, make sure the server has access to those networks
- The tool provides different analysis based on content type (HTML or XML)
- XML sitemap support includes both standard sitemaps and sitemap index files
- Supports sitemaps generated by various tools, including Yoast SEO

## How It Works

This tool uses a Node.js backend to avoid CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues:

1. The frontend sends a request to the local server
2. The server fetches the target website or XML sitemap using axios
3. The server automatically detects if the content is HTML or XML
4. For HTML: JavaScript parses the content and categorizes all links
5. For XML: The server parses the XML structure and extracts all URLs
6. The tool displays the appropriate results based on content type

## Technical Details

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js with Express, Axios, CORS middleware, and xml2js for XML parsing
- The server acts as a proxy to bypass CORS restrictions
- Works with most modern browsers with JavaScript enabled
