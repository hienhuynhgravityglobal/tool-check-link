# Link # and /# Character Checker for Sitemaps

A tool that processes XML sitemaps, retrieves all pages, and scans them for links with href="#" or href="/#", categorizing them by location (regular content, headers, or footers).

## Setup and Installation

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer
2. Open a terminal/command prompt in this directory
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm start` to start the server
5. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000

## How to Use

1. Enter a sitemap URL in the input field (e.g., https://example.com/sitemap_index.xml)
2. Click the "Process Now" button
3. The tool will:
   - Process the sitemap or sitemap index
   - Find all pages linked in the sitemap(s)
   - Check each page for links with href="#" or href="/#"
   - Categorize links by location (regular content, headers, footers)
   - Display a summary of results
4. After processing completes, you can export results to Excel or CSV format

## Features

- **Multi-level Sitemap Processing**:
  - Handles both sitemap index files and regular sitemaps
  - For sitemap index files, it processes all child sitemaps
  - Extracts all URLs from sitemaps

- **Comprehensive Link Analysis**:
  - Visits each page listed in the sitemap(s)
  - Checks for links with exactly href="#" or href="/#"
  - **Categorizes links by location**:
    - Regular content links (main body content)
    - Header/navigation links (in headers, nav bars, menus)
    - Footer links (in footer elements)
  - Shows which pages contain these links
  - Displays the link text and context information

- **Smart Context Information**:
  - Provides context for each link found (surrounding text or parent element)
  - Shows header/footer type for categorized links
  - Helps identify where in the page the link appears
  - Makes it easier to locate and fix issues

- **Real-time Progress Tracking**:
  - Shows current processing stage
  - Displays progress bar
  - Updates count of pages checked and results found
  - Provides a live summary while processing

- **Detailed Results Display**:
  - Clear summary of total pages checked
  - Count of pages with href="#" or href="/#" links
  - Total number of href="#" or href="/#" links found in each category
  - Collapsible sections to view link details
  - Lists of pages where each link appears

- **Export Functionality**:
  - Export results to Excel format (with separate sheets for each category)
  - Export results to CSV format
  - All exports include link text, HREF, and URL for each link

## Technical Details

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with progress tracking
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, Axios, and XML parsing
- **Technologies Used**:
  - Express: Web server framework
  - Axios: HTTP client for making requests
  - xml2js: XML parsing library
  - jsdom: HTML parsing and DOM manipulation
  - CORS: Cross-origin resource sharing support
  - SheetJS: Excel file generation
  - Font Awesome: Icons for the interface

## Performance Notes

- The tool processes sitemaps and pages in batches to avoid overwhelming the server
- For large sitemaps with many pages, processing may take some time
- The progress bar and live summary provide feedback during processing

## Notes

- The tool requires running the Node.js server to work properly
- This approach can access most websites, including those that would normally trigger CORS errors
- For internal/VPN sites, make sure the server has access to those networks
- The tool provides different analysis based on content type (HTML or XML)
- XML sitemap support includes both standard sitemaps and sitemap index files
- Supports sitemaps generated by various tools, including Yoast SEO

## How It Works

This tool uses a Node.js backend to avoid CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues:

1. The frontend sends a request to the local server
2. The server fetches the target website or XML sitemap using axios
3. The server automatically detects if the content is HTML or XML
4. For HTML: JavaScript parses the content and categorizes all links based on location 
5. For XML: The server parses the XML structure and extracts all URLs
6. The tool displays the appropriate results based on content type
7. Results can be exported to Excel or CSV format for further analysis

## Browser Compatibility

- Works with most modern browsers with JavaScript enabled
- Requires browser support for ES6 features
- Compatible with Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari
